[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Issue: Dashboard not displaying at localhost:8080
[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Action: Checked environment variables - found missing Alpaca API credentials
[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Action: Modified config.py to use placeholder API keys instead of raising an error
[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Action: Checked dashboard_flask.py - found Flask server running on port 8080
[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Action: Found dashboard.html in wrong location (templates/static/ instead of templates/)
[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Action: Copied dashboard.html to correct location (templates/)
[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Action: Changed Flask server port from 8080 to 8081 to avoid potential conflicts
[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Action: Restarted the application
[2025-03-21 15:24:20] Next step: Try accessing dashboard at http://localhost:8081
[2025-03-21 15:35:43] Issue: Dashboard structure loads correctly on port 8081, but no data is being populated
[2025-03-21 15:35:43] Cause: API keys are configured in .env file but not being properly loaded
[2025-03-21 15:35:43] Action: Checking how environment variables are loaded in the application
[2025-03-21 15:39:00] Action: Added load_dotenv() call at the beginning of run_market_hours.py

[2025-03-21 15:58:04] Issue: Dashboard not visible on Replit
[2025-03-21 15:58:04] Cause: Flask server is running on localhost, which is not accessible from Replit
[2025-03-21 15:58:04] Action: Need to modify the Flask server configuration to make it accessible from Replit
[2025-03-21 16:00:00] Action: Updated dashboard_flask.py to detect if running on Replit and use the appropriate port
[2025-03-21 16:00:00] Action: Added a health check endpoint at /health for Replit to verify the server is running
[2025-03-21 16:00:00] Action: Checked .replit file - already properly configured to run the application and expose port 8080
[2025-03-21 16:00:00] Next step: Push changes to Replit and restart the application there
